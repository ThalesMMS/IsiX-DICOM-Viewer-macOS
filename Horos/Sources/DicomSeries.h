// DicomSeries, the Core Data entity class of a series, is implemented in Swift
// since #721 (Horos/Sources/DicomSeries.swift). This header keeps
// <Horos/DicomSeries.h>: it brings in the generated interface, which declares
// the same class name and selectors, the Core Data accessors of its images
// relationship, and THUMBNAILSIZE.

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

#define THUMBNAILSIZE 70

// headers that use the class while this one is still being read.

#else
// A target without Swift, the Decompress helper: DCMPix.m names DicomSeries
// there, as it did, without its implementation.
